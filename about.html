            The original restaurant was our New Bern location. It came about because I am half Thai and half German and my family moved us to New Bern, NC. Although we were intimidated by moving to a new city with no one we know we decided to make the best of it and make New Bern our new home. To do that we decided to bring a little bit of our home and culture with us and share it with those around us.
